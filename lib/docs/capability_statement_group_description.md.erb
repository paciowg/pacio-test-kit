# Background

The Capability Statement Group tests a FHIR server's ability to formally describe
features supported by the API by using the [Capability
Statement](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html) resource.
The features described in the Capability Statement must be consistent with
the required capabilities of a <%= config.options[:ig] %> server. The Capability Statement
must also advertise the location of the required SMART on FHIR endpoints
that enable authenticated access to the FHIR server resources.

The Capability Statement resource allows clients to determine which
resources are supported by a FHIR Server. Not all servers are expected to
implement all possible queries and data elements described in the <%= config.options[:ig] %>
API.

# Test Methodology

This test sequence accesses the server endpoint at `/metadata` using a
`GET` request. It parses the Capability Statement and verifies that:

  * The endpoint is secured by an appropriate cryptographic protocol
  * The resource matches the expected FHIR version defined by the tests
  * The resource is a valid FHIR resource
  * The server claims support for JSON encoding of resources
  * The server claims support for the <%= config.options[:supported_resources]&.to_sentence %>.
