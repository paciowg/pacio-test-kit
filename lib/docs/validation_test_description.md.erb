This test verifies resources returned from the read and search tests conform to the [PACIO <%= config.options[:profile] %>](<%= pacio_profiles[config.options[:profile]] %>) profile.

It verifies the presence of mandatory elements and that elements with required bindings contain appropriate values.
CodeableConcept element bindings will fail if none of their codings have a code/system belonging to the bound ValueSet.
Quantity, Coding, and code element bindings will fail if their code/system are not found in the valueset.

This test will be skipped if no resource read requests were made in previous tests or if all requests were unsuccessful.
